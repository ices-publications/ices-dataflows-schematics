**ICES Dataflows Schematics Publication Series**

ICES aims to provide quality control and assurance processes in an end-to-end quality assurance framework that will encompass best practice in data management, data integration, and translation into advice. This series focusses on one aspect of this framework, which is to have well described and standard schematics of each of the data flows coming through the ICES data management systems.
